# Twitter_API_week6
## Twitter Introduction
This assignment teaches me how to interact with twitter API. I also learned and get used to with twitter developer account.
first I created that account and generate some API keys then I've stored it for future purposes.This assignmnet is about posting new tweet and deleting the tweet with authentication and app permissions.
## setup Instructions
### Step1: I've created twitter developer account with email credentials.
### step2: Then I,ve generated API including client Id and token seceret and save it for referenece.
### step3: After that, I've set environment variables so that no one can access my seceret token.
### step4: I wrote logic for posting new tweet and deleting the tweet.
### step5: I ran the program and faced so much errors.
## Progaram Details
I created two functions with posting tweet and deleteing tweet.then, I wrote code for setting environment variables and wrote code for OAuth1 setup.After that, set headers and created http requests also wrote logic for reading response body.
for delete the tweet, I defined tweetid and sent the request for delete the tweet.I created multiple tweets and delete one specific tweet with Id.
In main function, I called the both function and ran for loop for posting tweets.
Example of API requests: POST https://api.x.com/2/tweets
{
  "text": "Hello from the Twitter API!"
}
## Error Handling
I faced too many errors by running the program. I faced errors like 401 unautorized access, then I checked OAuth1 setup documentation on twitter then wrote code according to that.
I also got 403 forbidden error and got to know that twitter doesn't allow same content while posting new tweets.
error was like this: Posting tweet: Hey There!
